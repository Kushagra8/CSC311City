'''
This code snippet reads a dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses it, 
and prepares the data for training a machine learning model.
'''

'''
Preprocessing Functions: Several functions (to_numeric, get_number_list, 
get_number_list_clean, get_number, find_area_at_rank, cat_in_s, 
create_dummies_with_all_categories, normalize_column) are defined to 
preprocess the data. These functions handle tasks such as converting 
strings to numeric values, extracting numbers from strings, creating 
dummy variables for categorical features, and normalizing numeric columns.
'''

'''
get_data Function: This function reads the CSV file, applies preprocessing 
to the numeric fields, converts categorical features into dummy variables, 
and prepares the features (x) and labels (y) for training the model.
It also splits the data into training and testing sets.
'''

'''
get_file_data Function: This function is similar to get_data, but it only 
preprocesses the data without splitting it into training and testing sets. 
It's designed to be used for obtaining data from a file without labels for 
inference or prediction tasks.
'''

'''
Main Function Call: The last line of the code calls the get_file_data 
function with the path to a CSV file as an argument, which triggers the 
data preprocessing steps and returns the processed data.
'''

'''
Overall, this code prepares a dataset for training a machine learning model 
by performing various preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature 
extraction, and transformation.
